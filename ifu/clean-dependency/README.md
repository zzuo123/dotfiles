## clean dependency
A tool to clean up whatever dependencies that `sudo apt autoclean` cannot remove when accidentally installed a package, if you still have access to the output when installing that package.

### Usage
Copy and paste the dependency of accidentally installed package in [in.txt](./in.txt), then run [clean.sh](./clean.sh) and wait for the magic to happen.
